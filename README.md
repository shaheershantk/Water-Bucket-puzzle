The problem is as follows. You go to the well with a 7 liter bucket and an 11 liter bucket. You wish to fill one of them with exactly X liters of water. How can you do this in the fewest number of operations, where each operation either fills or empties one of the two buckets.

Well if X is 7 or 11 then the answer is easy. One operation is all that is required. Suppose that X is 4. Here we can fill the 11 liter bucket from the well and then use it to fill the 7 liter bucket. That will leave 4 liters of water in the 11 liter bucket.

What if X is 6? Before proceeding, try to solve this on your own.
